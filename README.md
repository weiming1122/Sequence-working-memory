# Sequence-working-memory

Sequence working memory tasks are designed to assess an individual's ability to process and remember a series of stimuli presented over time.

The Temporal Response Function (TRF) is a method used to model the relationship between a continuous stimulus and the recorded neural activity, such as EEG signals. In sequence working memory tasks, TRF captures the temporal dynamics of the brain's response to the presented stimuli.

The Inverted Encoding Model (IEM) is an approach used to infer the underlying neural representations of a stimulus from recorded neural activity, such as EEG data. In sequence working memory tasks, the IEM is employed to encode and decode stimulus information in the brain's neural activity patterns.
